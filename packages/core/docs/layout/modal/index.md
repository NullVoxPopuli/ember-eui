<EuiText>
  A modal works best for focusing users' attention on a <strong>short</strong> amount of content and getting them to make a decision. Use it to temporarily interrupt a userâ€™s current task and block interactions to the content below it. If your modal content is more complex, or requires considerable time to complete, consider using an EuiFlyout instead.
