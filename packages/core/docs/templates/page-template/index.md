  <p>
  Page layouts are modular and fit together in a precise manner, though certain
  parts can also be added or removed as needed. EUI provides both the indivdual
  page components and an over-arching template for easily creating some
  pre-defined layouts.

    The template is a very fragile component that will cause unexpected results if nested.
