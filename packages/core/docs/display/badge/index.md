  <p>
<strong>EuiBadges</strong> are used to focus on important bits of information. Although they will automatically space themselves if you use them in a repetitive fashion it is good form to wrap them using a <strong>EuiBadgeGroup</strong> so that they will wrap when width is constrained (as seen below).
